# SSA Example: Genetic Toggle Switch
Stochastic simulation algorithm (Gillespie's) to approximate solutions to the chemical master equation for chemical reaction networks with an example for a genetic toggle switch. Implemented as a part of the topics in computational dynamics seminar during summer semester 2021 at Freie Universit√§t.

## Execution Instructions

To run the code that includes some background information about SSA and the genetic toggle switch example, open [SSA_Example_Toggle_switch.ipynb](https://github.com/meghaphone/SSA-toggle-switch/blob/main/SSA_Example_Toggle_Switch.ipynb) and click the Google colaboratory button to open in Google colaboratory. From there, you can execute the code in the style of a Jupyter notebook.
