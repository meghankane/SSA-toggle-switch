# SSA-toggle-switch
Stochastic simulation algorithm (Gillespie's) to approximate solutions to the chemical master equation for chemical reaction networks with an example for a genetic toggle switch. Implemented as a part of the topics in computational dynamics seminar during summer semester 2021 at Freie Universit√§t.
